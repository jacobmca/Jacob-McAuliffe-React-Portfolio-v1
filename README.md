## Description

This is a portfolio demonstrating my current coding skills. You can read a brief biography on me, look through a portfolio of curated projects I've created, submit a form to contact me, or download my resume as well as see a list of my front and back end skills. It also contains a footer linking to relevant social media profiles.

My portfolio utilizes React for the front end design and functionality. Styling is done through a combination of Boostrap and custom CSS. EmailJS and React-Hook Form are used for the Contact section.

## Credits
This program was created by Jacob McAuliffe for the UC Berkeley eDX Coding Boot Camp.

## Tests
First off, I would like to add more projects and skills to this as I continue to learn and grow as a coder! Outside of that, I'd like to continue updating the styling - create a more interactive, motion-based background that's more appealing to the sense. Ultimately this porfolio is as much of a display of my coding skills as the projects it displays, and the nicer I can make it look, the greater utility it will have.
